# Product Recommendation Platform – Frontend

## Overview

This React-based frontend is designed to provide a highly interactive user interface for our product recommendation system. The application adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Its main purpose is to display product lists, gather user input, and present personalized recommendations derived from the backend's machine learning models.

## Key Features

1. **Responsive Design**

   - Uses modern CSS and frameworks (e.g., Material-UI) to adapt to different screen resolutions, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all devices.

2. **React Router**

   - Implements navigation between different sections of the platform (e.g., product list, recommended products, user profile) via a single-page application (SPA) architecture.

3. **Recommendation Views**

   - Renders product recommendations generated by Collaborative Filtering (CF), Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Naive Bayes, Fuzzy Logic, or Sentiment Analysis from the backend.

4. **Add to Cart & Persistent Shopping**

   - Allows users to add products to their cart, preserves cart contents even after browser refresh or navigation changes.

5. **Formik for Form Validation**

   - Ensures data integrity and a user-friendly input process (e.g., user registrations, login forms, and contact requests).

6. **Framer Motion & Slick Carousel**
   - Uses animations (Framer Motion) and image carousels (Slick) to enhance user engagement and highlight important product details or promotional sections.

## Tech Stack

- **React** for building dynamic UI components.
- **Redux** (optional) for efficient state management.
- **Material-UI** or other styling libraries for cohesive design.
- **Axios or Fetch** for making API requests to the backend.
- **Formik** for streamlined form handling.
- **Framer Motion** and **Slick Carousel** for interactive UI/UX.

## How It Works

1. **API Calls**: The frontend communicates with the Django-based backend via RESTful endpoints to fetch product data, user profiles, and recommendation results.
2. **State Management**: User sessions, cart state, and partial recommendation logic (e.g., caching previous results) can be managed through Redux or React Context.
3. **Rendering Recommendations**: Based on user interactions and server responses, it conditionally displays product suggestions from various algorithms (CF, CBF, etc.).

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

Feel free to adjust configurations in the `.env` or `config.js` files for custom endpoints, environment variables, or styling preferences.
