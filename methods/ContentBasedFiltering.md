# Content-Based Filtering

I plan to use **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** to recommend items with attributes similar to those that a user already likes. By focusing on the properties or descriptions of products, this method tailors suggestions that match a user’s explicit interests.

## How It Works

- **Attribute Analysis**:  
  Each product will have metadata or descriptive fields—such as category, keywords, or textual descriptions—that represent its characteristics.

- **User Profiling**:  
  By examining which product attributes a user has shown interest in (through purchases, clicks, or ratings), I can construct a preference profile.

- **TF-IDF & Similarity**:  
  To quantify similarity among products, I will use **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) to vectorize text-based attributes, then compute similarity scores among product vectors.

## Implementation in My Project

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   I’ll store product descriptions in a database and transform them into vectors using Python libraries like **scikit-learn**.

2. **User Profile Building**:  
   For each user, I’ll aggregate the TF-IDF features of the items they have previously liked or purchased.

3. **Matching & Ranking**:  
   New recommendations are generated by comparing all available items against a user’s profile. High-scoring items are recommended.

4. **Frontend Display**:  
   In **React**, the “Recommended for You” section will fetch these suggestions from a dedicated API endpoint.
