                    <h4>Low temperatures, high efficiency</h4>
                    <p>Thanks to 4 efficient 120 mm RGB fans (one at the back, three at the front) and an open top and mesh front, Shobo SH4F RGB ensures free air flow through the housing. Combined with the possibility of installing an air CPU cooler up to 161 mm and a total of 8 fans (3 × front, 2 × top, 1 × rear, 2 × bottom), we get efficient cooling that can handle really powerful components.</p>
                    <h4>High cooling</h4>
                    <p>Do you want to expand your fragging machine with efficient water cooling? With Fury Shobo SH4F RGB its childs play. The housing allows you to install AIO LC coolers with the following sizes: front (360/280/240/140/120 mm), top (240/120 mm) and rear (120 mm). Such wide compatibility means freedom in selecting components - even the most powerful ones that require really high-end cooling.</p>
                    <h4>Effective dust barrier</h4>
                    <p>Dust penetrating the interior of the case is the nightmare of every computer system. With Fury Shobo SH4F RGB you dont have to worry about that anymore. The housing is completely filtered against dust: from the top and bottom, and the "mesh" front has very dense meshes with a diameter clearly below 1 mm, providing protection against dirt and facilitating free air flow.</p>
                    <h4>Great possibilities in a small housing</h4>
                    <p>While maintaining small external dimensions, the Shobo SH4F RGB case offers full compatibility with ATX, micro-ATX and mini-ITX motherboards. You can fit in it a powerful graphics card up to 330 mm long, up to 3 drives/media (HDD/SSD) and a CPU air cooler up to 161 mm. Two-chamber design with a "basement" for the power supply and numerous cable entries mean no mess and easy organization of components.</p>""",
