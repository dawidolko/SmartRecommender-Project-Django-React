# Contributing to TechByte

First off, **thank you** for considering contributing to **TechByte**! It's people like you that make this computer store application so valuable to the community. Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a new feature, or submitting a pull request, **every contribution** is highly appreciated.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways you can help TechByte evolve and grow. Below are guidelines for the most common contribution pathways.

---

## Reporting Issues

1. **Search First**

   - Before creating a new issue, please check the [issue tracker](../../issues) to see if the problem has already been reported.

2. **Provide Details**
   - If you haven’t found anything similar, go ahead and file an issue.
   - Use the bug report template if provided.
   - Include detailed steps to reproduce the behavior and any relevant information (e.g., environment, logs, screenshots).

Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand, reproduce, and fix the problem faster.

---

## Feature Requests

- We welcome and value new ideas. However, please take a moment to see if your idea aligns with the **scope and aims** of TechByte.
- Clearly describe the proposed feature, providing as much context and reasoning as possible.
- Think about how it will benefit other users and whether it fits into TechByte’s long-term goals.

If the idea is a good fit, maintainers or contributors can help refine and discuss how best to implement it.

## Pull Requests

1. **Link to an Issue**

   - Always ensure there’s a corresponding issue for the pull request. This way, everyone can see why the change is being proposed and track its progress.

2. **Branch Naming**

   - Create a new branch off `main` for your work, following these naming conventions:
     - **feature/your-feature** if you’re adding a feature
     - **bugfix/your-fix** if you’re fixing a bug

3. **Coding Conventions**

   - Maintain the style and structure consistent with the existing codebase.
   - Keep your code well-documented and easy to understand.

4. **Tests and CI**

   - Make sure your code passes all existing tests.
   - If you add a feature, include new tests to cover it.
   - We use Continuous Integration to ensure pull requests meet quality standards.

5. **Pull Request Template**

   - Fill out the pull request template to provide an overview of your changes.
   - Include screenshots, GIFs, or any visual aids that clarify your modifications.

6. **No Issue Numbers in Title**
   - Avoid referencing the issue number in the PR title. Instead, mention the issue number in the pull request description (e.g., “Resolves #123”).

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `main` branch reflects the latest **stable** release, so do not submit pull requests directly to `main` without good reason.
- Update **documentation** if your changes alter the API or usage of TechByte.
- Keep changes **atomic** and **focused**—small pull requests are easier to review and merge.
